Ranging from tranquil backwaters, lush green tea plantations, unique art forms to varied spices, there are many features you will find when searching for what Kerala is famous for. Kerala, also called 'God's Own Country,' is a beautiful tropical destination where people come to unwind and enjoy the natural beauty. Worship of Shiva and Vishnu is popular in Kerala. Lord Krishna is worshipped widely in all parts of Kerala, Guruvayur being one of the most famous temples in the state. Malayali Hindus also worship Bhagavathi as a form of Shakti. Almost every village in Kerala has a Bhagavati Goddess. The literary meaning of Kerala is "the land of coconuts". "Kera" in Malayalam (the language of Kerala) means coconut.
